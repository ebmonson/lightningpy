## Cloudy Configuration

Electron density: lognH = [2,3.5]
Not a free parameter, but can be selected with the `lognH` keyword.

ionization parameters, logU = [-1.5,-2.0,-2.5,-3.0,-3.5,-4.0]

grains : off

Metallicity ranging from 12 + log(O/H) = 6.5 to 8.9 with step 0.1 where solar = 8.69.
Stellar metallicity set to the same as gas metallicity, with Zsolar = 0.020.

Open geometry

The IMF is the Kroupa+(2001) IMF, from 0.1-100 solar masses.
