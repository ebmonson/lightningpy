======================================

``plightning`` is the python prototype of the Lightning SED-fitting code.
The goal of the project is to maintain Lightning's primary design philosophy
of simplicty and physically-based models, while taking advantage of Python's
object-oriented nature and the wide array of pre-existing astronomical Python
code to improve modularity and user-friendliness.
