# Model Demos
-----------

This directory contains notebooks showing the variation in `Lightning` models with changing parameters.

It is intended as a quick reference, allowing you to see where you might (or might not) have data to constrain
the model parameters.

For a similar but slightly more in-depth quick reference from IDL `Lightning` see Doore et al. (2023) Section 2, especially Figures 1-7.
